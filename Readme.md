### Introduction ‚≠ê
Hey, this is Kairos. 

I've compiled what I've learned, thought about, and felt into this blog website, hoping that content within can be helpful to everyone. And I have come to realize, now, that having the choice to do the things I‚Äôm interested in brings out an enthusiasm I can explore passionately and fully.

The original idea for this project came from [`CLQ`](https://clq9920.github.io/), and I am grateful for his sharing. However, the original environment did not support writing mathematical formulas, so we added `Mathjax` environment to render the formulas. In the future, we also plan to add more convenient features.

For me personally, the blog will serve as a platform to document my growth and journey. I hope that many years from now, when I look back on all of those things, I will feel a sense of contentment.
